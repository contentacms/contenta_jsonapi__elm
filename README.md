# Contenta JSONAPI elm

This project tries to implement a decoupled frontend for the [contenta](https://github.com/drupal-http-apis/contenta_jsonapi) distribution.

## Elm
This implementation of the frontend is implemented using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), which is "a delightful language for relieable webapps".

## Contributions

* If you are a PHP/JS developer join the contenta slack channel, and you can contribute to all kind of projects, and maybe even learn elm along the way?
* If you are an experienced Elm developer, please for example give recommendations in best practices. Some of the code is certainly not ideal yet.

## Dependencies

* [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)

## Installation

* Install the dependencies with yarn: ```yarn install```
* Install the Elm packages: ```elm package install```

## Development

* For development run ```yarn app-dev```. This opens a live reloading browser on ```localhost:8000```

## Running tests

## Production

## General TODOs

* Try to implement the designs of the frontend of the recipe site. First just basic HTML structure but later actual CSS.
* Continue work on the JsonapiHelper.elm file, which should make it easier to query data.
* Provide support of a switchable backend, by using ```programWithFlags```.
